# old PHP Chat Site aka 'Phoenix Chat'

⚠️ Much of this code is old and should not be used without significant refactoring! ⚠️

This was written entirely by a noob without following best practices of any kind, inside these scripts you will find:

> Security holes and hacky bypasses.

> Lots of repetition.

> Newer code on top of older code.

> Defunct scripts that never got removed.

> mySQL not even in PDO statements (some of this code is 16 years old)

> And many more violations. It's basically a PHP Haunted House.


Phoenix Chat was a community chat site designed for use on mobile telephones between 2004 and 2006.

It was intended to compete against websites that nobody remembers; such as MoPilot, Wapoc (formerly Wapocalypse), OmniChat and ProDigits.

The site comprised the following features:

> Threaded discussion boards (forums).

> Real time chat (like IRC).

> Private Messaging (for long conversations).

> Pop Up Messaging (for quicker communication).

> Email (via pop3 & imap).

> Friends (before facebook, this was known as a 'buddy list'.

> User Blogs (each user could start a blog).

> Rich Text Formatting (for pm, chat, forums & blogs).

> The ability to upload & share media.

> User ranking system.

> Customizable themes.

> User profiles.


The website was originally written in WML (wireless mark-up language) and was later converted to xHTML (extensible HTML); both were 'strict' languages and any syntax errors resulted in 'Error 500' appearing on mobile devices.
For a time, two versions ran concurrently; a script detected what types a connected device could accept and redirected the user accordingly.

The version of the website here was a development copy and as such contains a lot of unfinished code as well as bits of randomness I couldn't possibly fathom now, all these years later.

A more complete version was packaged and sold a number of times to people who, for lack of a better description, wanted to be the one to ban people they didn't like.  Due to this, there existed a number of 'copies' of the same site in existence, which all had the same style, features and in several cases, the same userbases.  There were a number of other sites (such as those listed above) which were also copied and pasted a number of times.  The net result of this was the existence of hundreds of the same 5 or 6 WAP sites who's userbases were diluted again and again until most sites had an average 5 or 6 users online at any one time.

The ecosystem it existed in was known as "WAP" (Wireless Applications Protocol); even long after the days of WML and traditional WAP, people continued to call it this.

I closed the site in 2006 after most of the userbase migrated to Facebook.

When the site closed, the following features were in development, but were never finished:

> The ability to create one's own WAP site without writing code (To compete with pepperonity / o2 communities)

> Native email, i.e. user@phoenixchat.co.uk (as opposed to pop3/imap)

> SMS messaging between the site and user devices.

Most of the code was written by myself but third party scripts for Device Detection and POP3 Polling were used.
It would be impossible for me to find and credit the authors now, but if you see your code here and want to be credited, please get in touch!

The purpose of this repo is:
> To tell a tale of internet days gone by that has been completely forgotten by history.

> To show my coding roots.

> As a showcase of some of the worst code you'll ever see. a "what not to do" if you will.
